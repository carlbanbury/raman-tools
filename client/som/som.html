            <h3>Self Organising Maps (SOM)</h3>
            <p>Self organising maps allow visualisation of high dimensional data, similar to PCA plots. The
            main advantage of using SOM over PCA is the space is filled more efficiently and data presented more intuatively
            to the reader. This makes life easier, when there are several overlapping clusters.</p>

            <h5>Example: Spatially Grouping Shades of Colour</h5>
            <p>The example below groups shades of colour on a hexagonal grid. This is a simplistic example, so includes only 5 shades of red, 3 shades
            of green and one of blue. The SOM places the colours on a the grid according to which it decides are most similar. </p>

            <h5>Which Variable Matters?</h5>
            <p>
                We are normally interested with which variable is defining why the data has clustered how it has. For SOM, this is relatively simple. Each coloured point on
                the board represents one of our samples. For the example of a colour above, this is a three dimensional vector, such as [255, 0, 0] for red defined in RGB
                colour space. This means our board is actually made of three colour stacks: red green and blue.
            </p>
            <p>
                With our samples in the position on the board, we can display their values for each of the three colour dimensions in turn. The image below shows an example
                for the colour, red. Samples that contribute heavily to this colour are highlighted in yellow. Cells that have a low red value are shown in brown.
                For this example, this is trivially obvious. However, if colour is replaced by spectral data then markers responsible for inherent clusters within the
                data can easily be identified in the same way.
